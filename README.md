# tcgaBrca
The Johan Staaf-lab repository containing scripts for downloading and preprocessing TCGA BRCA data from the [Genomic Data Commons](https://portal.gdc.cancer.gov/) repository. 

## Description
The pipeline uses the included manifest and annotation files to perform automated download and processing of gene expression, DNA methylation, copy-number, and somatic mutation data for all available tumor samples. A core data set with available data on all levels is produced and filtered against TCGA sample blacklists. The scripts produce a final data set comprising 630 unique breast cancer cases. 

## Data types

### RNA-seq

### SNP6-Copy number data

### DNA methylation

### Whole exome sequencing

## Usage
The scripts contained generate a directory structure for data download, preprocessing and annotation
